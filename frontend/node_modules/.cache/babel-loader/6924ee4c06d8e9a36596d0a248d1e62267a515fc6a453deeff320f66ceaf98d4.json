In order to compare as few fields as possible, this makes\n * a series of comparisons \"within\" sets of fields and \"between\" sets of fields.\n *\n * Given any selection set, a collection produces both a set of fields by\n * also including all inline fragments, as well as a list of fragments\n * referenced by fragment spreads.\n *\n * A) Each selection set represented in the document first compares \"within\" its\n * collected set of fields, finding any conflicts between every pair of\n * overlapping fields.\n * Note: This is the *only time* that a the fields \"within\" a set are compared\n * to each other. After this only fields \"between\" sets are compared.\n *\n * B) Also, if any fragment is referenced in a selection set, then a\n * comparison is made \"between\" the original set of fields and the\n * referenced fragment.\n *\n * C) Also, if multiple fragments are referenced, then comparisons\n * are made \"between\" each referenced fragment.\n *\n * D) When comparing \"between\" a set of fields and a referenced fragment, first\n * a comparison is made between each field in the original set of fields and\n * each field in the the referenced set of fields.\n *\n * E) Also, if any fragment is referenced in the referenced selection set,\n * then a comparison is made \"between\" the original set of fields and the\n * referenced fragment (recursively referring to step D).\n *\n * F) When comparing \"between\" two fragments, first a comparison is made between\n * each field in the first referenced set of fields and each field in the the\n * second referenced set of fields.\n *\n * G) Also, any fragments referenced by the first must be compared to the\n * second, and any fragments referenced by the second must be compared to the\n * first (recursively referring to step F).\n *\n * H) When comparing two fields, if both have selection sets, then a comparison\n * is made \"between\" both selection sets, first comparing the set of fields in\n * the first selection set with the set of fields in the second.\n *\n * I) Also, if any fragment is referenced in either selection set, then a\n * comparison is made \"between\" the other set of fields and the\n * referenced fragment.\n *\n * J) Also, if two fragments are referenced in both selection sets, then a\n * comparison is made \"between\" the two fragments.\n *\n */\n// Find all conflicts found \"within\" a selection set, including those found\n// via spreading in fragments.
