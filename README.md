# Welcome to Aggie Compute!
We value everybody's contribution to bringing our idea to fruition. 

This [board](https://github.com/orgs/aggie-coding-club/projects/4) is where you will see all your assignments for the project, and it is linked to our project repository to track everybody's work.

We are striving for a **_low-stress, interactive learning experience_** for every member, and don't think that your skillsets aren't where they need to be; like Jason said, we are firm believers that everybody can do web development or any coding aspect as long as they have the motivation and will to do so!

If you have any questions, please contact us, your project managers: </br >
